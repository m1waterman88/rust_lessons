Cargo: build system, package manager, dependency handling
Crates: rust packages

Updates: rustup update

Basic:
  Compile: rustc <filename.rs>
  Run as executable.

Cargo:
  Separate Cargo docs: https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/

  01. cargo new project_name
  2a. from project_name dir:
        cargo build
        ./target/debug/project_name
  2b. like 2a but in one step, from project_name dir:
        cargo run

  Or: check if code compiles w/o producing a binary,
      which can cut out time of creating a binary
      when continually checking work:
        cargo check


  builds:
    cargo build
      builds executable in ./target/debug/
    cargo build --release
      builds executable in ./target/release/

  NOTE: cargo commands are OS agnostic: Linux, macOS, or Windows
